## Notable Projects:-

### 1.Power BI Dashboards for Business Automation:-
Designed and implemented Power BI dashboards for employee events and inventory management at Openmynz Softlabs Pvt. Ltd. Utilized advanced visualizations, DAX scripts, and integrated solutions with Microsoft SharePoint to automate workflows and notifications.

### 2.AQI Levels Prediction Using Environmental Images
Developed a deep learning-based system to classify air quality index (AQI) levels from environmental images collected across India and Nepal. Leveraged convolutional neural networks (VGG16 and ResNet50) with transfer learning, data augmentation, and class weighting to address class imbalance and optimize model performance.

  ‚Ä¢Achieved 96.8% classification accuracy across six AQI categories (‚ÄúGood‚Äù to ‚ÄúSevere‚Äù) using the VGG16 architecture.

  ‚Ä¢Enabled scalable, real-time air quality monitoring in regions lacking sensor infrastructure, supporting public health and environmental policy.

  ‚Ä¢The project demonstrated robust results, with the model excelling in both accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for practical deployment in diverse environments
